# Apple Global Revenue Pulse (2021–2025)
## Overview

This project simulates how a Business Intelligence (BI) team tracks Apple’s global revenue performance across regions over time.

Using a simplified but structured dataset derived from Apple’s public financial disclosures, I built an executive-style Power BI dashboard to analyze:
- Regional revenue contribution
- Year-over-year (YoY) growth trends
- Long-term revenue patterns across major markets

The goal was not just visualization, but to ensure clean data modeling, correct YoY logic, and KPIs that reflect how real business dashboards are built and consumed.

## Key Insights

- **Americas dominate total revenue**, contributing ~43% of overall sales between 2021–2025, making it Apple’s most stable and reliable market.
- **Europe and Greater China remain important growth pillars**, showing steady performance despite slower momentum typical of mature markets.
- **YoY growth rebounded to ~6% in 2025** after a dip in 2023, aligning with Apple’s typical product refresh cycles.
- Regional revenue distribution highlights Apple’s dependence on developed markets while maintaining diversification across Asia-Pacific regions.

## Data Notes

- Data is a **simplified analytical dataset** created for portfolio and learning purposes.
- Figures are inspired by Apple’s public filings but are structured to support BI-style analysis rather than financial reporting.
- The focus is on analytics logic, modeling, and storytelling — not exact financial reconciliation.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI** – dashboard design and KPI modeling  
- **Excel** – data cleaning, transformation, and consolidation
